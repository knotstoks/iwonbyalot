  dialogueLines:
  - With the influx of meat into the Districts, more and more people develop some
    sort of 'Herd Mentality'
  - As you walk through the Districts while campaigning you start to see more and
    more people choosing to stand around grass patches and eat grass
  - Not the weirdest thing you've seen but alright
  - The Majority Winner in each District gains 2 more Votes!
